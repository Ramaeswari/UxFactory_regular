        <h2>Callback Function Example in Javascript</h2>
        <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument</p>
        <p>There are 2 types of callbacks: <b>synchronous</b> and <b>asynchronous</b> callbacks</p>
        <p>If our code executes sequentially from top to bottom, it is <b>synchronous</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Asynchronous</b> means that if JavaScript has to wait for an operation to complete, it will execute the rest of the code while waiting.</p>
